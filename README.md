WhereMyTokens is a local-first desktop app for monitoring AI coding usage: quota windows, token totals, API-equivalent cost estimates, cache efficiency, sessions, model usage, activity patterns, and git output.

## Download

| Platform | Download | Best For |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Windows 10/11 | **[Installer (.exe)](https://github.com/jeongwookie/WhereMyTokens/releases/download/v1.24.3/WhereMyTokens-Setup.exe)** | Normal installation, auto-start from the tray |
| Windows 10/11 — 日本語 UI | **[Japanese UI installer](https://github.com/jeongwookie/WhereMyTokens/releases/download/v1.24.3/WhereMyTokens-Setup.exe)** | Same installer; Japanese Windows opens in Japanese automatically, or choose Settings → General → Language |
| Windows 10/11 | **[Portable ZIP](https://github.com/jeongwookie/WhereMyTokens/releases/download/v1.24.3/WhereMyTokens-v1.24.3-win-x64.zip)** | No installer, keep it anywhere |
| macOS Apple Silicon | **[macOS Edition](https://github.com/jeongwookie/WhereMyTokens-mac/releases/tag/mac-v1.1.1)** | Menu bar app with DMG/ZIP packaging |

Looking for the menu bar version? See the separate [WhereMyTokens for macOS repository](https://github.com/jeongwookie/WhereMyTokens-mac), which has its own `mac-vX.Y.Z` release track and DMG/ZIP downloads.

By downloading or installing, you agree to the [End-User License Agreement](EULA.txt).

Japanese UI is built into the Windows app. It follows your system language by default on Japanese Windows, and you can override it from Settings → General → Language. Thanks to [@restructure-git](https://github.com/restructure-git) for the translation and key-structure groundwork in [PR #37](https://github.com/jeongwookie/WhereMyTokens/pull/37).

## First Run

1. Install with `WhereMyTokens-Setup.exe`, or extract the portable ZIP and run `WhereMyTokens.exe`.
2. Open the dashboard from the Windows tray.
3. Enable the providers you use: Claude Code, Codex, Antigravity, or any combination.
4. Enable **Claude Code Integration** to register the official `statusLine` bridge for live Claude quota data.

## What's New

| Version | Date | Highlights |
|---------|------|------------|
| **[v1.24.5](docs/usage-accounting.md#automatic-historical-accounting-revision)** | 2026-09-10 | Local build: automatically verify and correct proven historical Codex overcounts with backups, resumable source receipts, and a results/recheck view. |
| **[v1.24.4](docs/usage-accounting.md)** | 2026-09-10 | Local build: fix Codex cost inflation caused by mixed thread and notification counters; preserve counter origins across turns and restarts. |
| **[v1.24.3](https://github.com/jeongwookie/WhereMyTokens/releases/tag/v1.24.3)** | Aug 27 | Restore Antigravity 2.x detection on Windows and show provider-reported shared Gemini and Claude/GPT quota groups with safe legacy per-model fallback |
| **[v1.24.2](https://github.com/jeongwookie/WhereMyTokens/releases/tag/v1.24.2)** | Aug 10 | Add actionable Claude login recovery with a one-time Windows notification, the official CLI login flow, credential-change auto-retry, and stale-quota preservation without refreshing or writing credentials |
| **[v1.24.1](https://github.com/jeongwookie/WhereMyTokens/releases/tag/v1.24.1)** | Aug 10 | Restore Claude quota when Claude Desktop is active and existing Claude Code credentials are available, even without fresh statusLine data; keep official statusLine first and remove all token refresh/write behavior |

## Highlights

- `provider checkboxes` for Claude Code, Codex, Antigravity, or any combination.
- Provider adapters live under `src/main/providers/` and translate provider-reported limits into one canonical Quota Entry shape, separate from local token/cost usage.
- Dynamic Claude Code, Codex, and Antigravity quota cards preserve provider scope, reset time, known-or-unknown duration, and explicit unlimited state. Antigravity 2.x uses the provider-reported `Gemini Models` and `Claude and GPT models` shared groups, with legacy per-model local RPC fallback. Missing limits are absent rather than synthesized as `Unlimited`.
- Claude account limits prefer the official Claude Code `statusLine` 5h/7d fields. When Claude Code is not producing statusLine updates, a read-only compatibility fallback can query the same account windows using the existing Claude Code access token. A model-scoped target such as Fable appears only when one of those provider-reported sources includes it; WhereMyTokens does not infer missing limits.
- When Claude Code login expires or is rejected, WhereMyTokens shows one Windows notification and an in-app action that opens the official `claude auth login` flow. It watches for the credential change and retries automatically, without refreshing tokens or writing credentials itself.
- Optional draggable Windows taskbar mini display uses two physical lines for normalized 5h/7d entries. Two represented periods use one line each; a single represented period can use both lines, with configurable 1-3 blocks per line and compact `+N` hidden-target cues.
- Built-in Japanese UI with a Settings → General → Language selector.
- Codex reset-credit availability can appear as a separate Plan Usage target, with Rich, Simple, or hidden display modes in Settings.
- Active and recent session tracking from local provider data.
- Today and all-time token, cost, cache, model, and call summaries.
- Activity heatmaps, rhythm charts, model usage, and tool breakdowns.
- Git output metrics for persistently tracked repositories, independent of recent session membership, with reversible project exclusions.
- Persistent totals use the source-attributed `usage-index.sqlite`. Request detail is retained for 8 days, hourly precision for 35 days, daily precision for 180 days, and monthly totals indefinitely. First indexing stays responsive and labels incomplete coverage; **Reset index** discards indexed history and rebuilds only from currently available provider logs.
- Local-first storage with no cloud sync or telemetry.

## Privacy

WhereMyTokens reads local provider files and calls only the enabled providers that require a live usage request. It does not upload session logs, run cloud sync, or ask you to paste API keys.

Claude quota monitoring prefers the local Claude Code `statusLine`. When no fresh statusLine quota exists and Claude Code credentials are available, the Desktop compatibility fallback loads `~/.claude/.credentials.json`, extracts the existing access token plus plan metadata, and sends only the access token to the fixed HTTPS host `api.anthropic.com` for a quota request. It ignores the refresh-token property, never refreshes credentials, and never writes the credential file. One request may occur on app launch; during the same run, requests are limited to once per 15 minutes, apply timeout/response-size limits and 429 backoff, and do not retry a rejected access token unless it changes. Cached compatibility quota is bound to a one-way token marker and expires at the earlier of its reported reset time and a 30-minute cap.

Codex live usage and reset-credit checks use `~/.codex/auth.json` only for direct OpenAI/ChatGPT requests when Codex is enabled. Reset-credit cache stores counts, expiry times, fetch status, source labels, a hashed auth marker, and the auth file modified time.

Antigravity uses local RPC only. It does not use Google OAuth, refresh tokens, Google cloud usage endpoints, or offline database fallback.
